<h2 style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px"> {{< fa book >}} - Introduction </h2>

Turbulent flow over complex terrain plays a key role in many environmental and geophysical systems, such as wind energy, wave formation, and dune dynamics. 
<!--  -->
Compared to hills and mountains, **aeolian sand dunes**, due to their smooth and scalable shapes, **are ideal for studying wind-topography interactions**.
<!--  -->
While **topography feedback on wind speed** has been largely quantified an understood, much less is know **on the wind direction**, especially for **giant dunes, less studied for practical reasons**.
<!--  -->
While the resolution of global atmospheric models is getting more precise, their habilility to reproduce precisely near-surface wind remain to be assessed.

1. Can global atmospheric models predict near-surface winds in arid areas? 
2. Does giant dunes signficantly affect the atmospheric flow?

ERA5-land (climate reanalysis) + local wind measurements comparison in 4 different places in the Namib desert.
